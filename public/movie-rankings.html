    <h1>Max's top 3 movies</h1>
 <h2>These are my favorite movies right now, subject to change.</h2>
 <hr>
 <h3>About Time</h3>
<p>This movie was absolutely heart-wrenching in a good way. Really makes you want to start enjoying every moment of life.</p>
<h3>Set it Up</h3>
<p>If you want to believe in finding love in a unique way this is it. I think soulmates are real and this movie shows it. </p>
<h3>Thor:Ragnarok</h3>
<p>Love marvel movies and this is in my opinion one of the best. Perfect mix of action and feelings and just like pure amazingness that makes this movie work</p>
